## 1. Introduction and Motivation

### 1.1 Initial Situation

Industrial automation faces the challenge of integrating heterogeneous systems with different protocols, architectures, and communication patterns. Within the research work at the Chair of Industrial Communication Technology at TU Dresden under Prof. Dr.-Ing. habil. Martin Wollschlaeger, the Asset Administration Shell (AAS) Framework according to IEC 63278 was developed as a standardized approach for digital twins in Industry 4.0, or from a digital perspective Industry 3.2. The aas-core-works implementation supervised by Santiago Soler Perez Olaya reveals a complete compiler architecture based on an M3/M2/M1 metamodel structure – analogous to the approaches of Prof. Castrillon in the field of compiler design at TU Dresden.

The current implementation of the AAS framework uses Python scripts that simulate compiler functionality: The aas-core-meta repository defines the M3 metamodel in simplified Python, while aas-core-codegen generates target language SDKs from it (C++, C#, Python, TypeScript, Java, Golang). Despite this functional code generation, a complete compiler implementation as an external translator program is missing that can be used as a standalone, maintainable tool in industrial production environments.

VIA (Virtual Industry Automation) addresses this gap through a **self-compiling bootstrap mechanism**: The VIA main program first compiles the M3 compiler from AAS metamodel definitions, tests it, and uses it to generate the M2 SDK. This SDK is in turn compiled, tested, and used to translate customer projects (M2→M1). A Software-in-the-Loop (SITL) system automates the AI-supported transformation of textual specifications (AAS IEC 63278, OPC UA IEC 62541) into executable M3 model code, as well as fully autonomous adaptation, implementation, and testing of program code (System on call / SOC). While aas-core-works generates static SDKs, VIA enables through this bootstrap approach continuous automation from text specification to deployed industrial system – including the capability for self-modification and hot-reload of the main program during operation.

### 1.2 Vision: Industry 5.0 (Or rather: Industry 3.3)

The next generation of industrial automation – Industry 5.0 (Kagermann et al., 2013) – requires a fundamental paradigm shift: Instead of manual system configuration and programming, an AI-driven system description should be enabled, where users describe their system in natural language. The target system performs automatic compilation and deployment, with Software-in-the-Loop procedures enabling iterative error correction against customer specifications. The long-term goal of this research vision is: "The customer describes their system to the AI, the AI defines a compiler description, the compiler generates the functional system."

Taking this step further, the customer can define systems that define themselves or construct systems that independently take over and execute the architecture and definition part, resulting in M3 self-definition and construction.

This vision requires continuous automation from abstract metamodel to deployed system on heterogeneous edge devices. VIA (Virtual Industry Automation) pursues this approach through a multi-stage compiler chain (M3→M2→M1), which first generates an SDK from a metamodel (M3→M2), creates system projects from customer projects (M2→M1), and finally deploys these on more than 50,000 edge devices (M1 deployment).

### 1.3 Research Gap

Despite existing metamodel frameworks and code generators, there is a fundamental research gap between metamodel definition and production-grade compiler implementation. Previous approaches such as aas-core-codegen (aas-core-works, 2024) do generate executable code, but the connection to automated deployment is missing: There is no maintainable, versioned SDK generation for long-term industrial use (typically 15-25 years in the manufacturing industry, cf. Adolphs et al., 2015), no automatic orchestration of generated systems, and no optimization of process communication at compile time.

Manual orchestration of more than 50,000 edge devices in a typical automotive factory is practically unreasonable and error-prone. Additionally, heterogeneous target architectures (MIPS, RISC-V, POWER9, x86, ARM, Sparc) require multi-target compilation, which is not provided in previous AAS implementations. In particular, there is no scientific investigation of whether and how microservice communication (IPC: Pipe, Unix Socket, TCP, File-Queue, Thread-Messaging) can be optimized at compile time to reduce latency and resource consumption compared to runtime orchestration.

A detailed analysis of research gaps in the context of existing approaches is provided in Section 3.7.

## 2. Problem Statement and Research Question

### 2.1 Context: VIA Overall System

VIA (Virtual Industry Automation) forms the overarching context of this research work. It is a multi-stage compiler chain (M3→M2→M1) for heterogeneous industrial systems with automatic orchestration of more than 50,000 edge devices. The overall system consists of three main components: The **M3 compiler** transforms the AAS metamodel into a language-specific SDK (C++, Python, Java), the **M2-SDK compiler** converts customer projects including network discovery into complete system projects, and the **M1 system deployer** performs cross-compilation, Horse-Rider deployment, and Kubernetes orchestration.

This architecture enables continuous automation from abstract system description to deployed system on heterogeneous hardware platforms. While the VIA overall system covers all aspects from metamodeling to deployment, the present research work focuses on a specific, critical sub-aspect: the optimization of process communication at compile time.

### 2.2 Focus of this Research Work: Process-Group-Protocol

The central research question of this work is:

> **Can process chains of microservices be automatically created via metamodels (M3/M2), whose positioning in the system and communication mechanism (IPC: Pipe, Socket, TCP, File-Queue, Thread) are optimized during compilation?**

This question addresses a fundamental challenge of modern microservice architectures: The choice of Inter-Process Communication (IPC) mechanism typically occurs at runtime through Service Mesh solutions like Istio or Linkerd. However, these runtime decisions cause overhead through dynamic routing, service discovery, and load balancing.

**VIA's Architectural Particularity: Self-Compiling Runtime System**: Unlike traditional compilers that work offline and produce static binaries, the VIA compiler is **part of the runtime environment (M0 level)**. The compilation process is executed at runtime of the own deployed service mesh – the compiler compiles itself and the system continuously. This architecture combines the advantages of both worlds:

1. **Compiler Quality with Runtime Flexibility**: IPC decisions are made **at runtime WITH THE OWN COMPILER**, not by external proxies (Istio/Linkerd). The VIA-M2-Compiler runs as a service in the M0 system and reacts to telemetry, network topology changes, and new process registrations.

2. **Incremental Recompilation**: Like real compilers, **only changed modules and their dependency chains** are recompiled. When a process changes its requirements (e.g., new latency constraints), VIA recompiles only the affected IPC paths – not the entire system.

3. **Kubernetes Sidecar as IPC Executor**: The IPC decisions calculated by the compiler are implemented as **Kubernetes Sidecars** according to **M3 scheduling rules**. The sidecar executes the generated communication patterns (Unix Socket, TCP, gRPC), monitors telemetry (latency, throughput, error rate), and reports deviations back to the compiler service.

4. **Statically Defined, Dynamically Adapted**: VIA maintains the **strict separation of model (M3 definitions) and implementation (M1 binaries)**, but allows **telemetry-based adaptations of static rules**. Example: M3 defines "max_latency: 5ms", but telemetry shows 8ms → Compiler recalculates, proposes process migration (from TCP → Unix Socket via container relocation).

This architecture is **neither pure compile-time nor pure runtime**, but a **continuous compile-runtime cycle**: The compiler is always active, but its decisions are based on compiler-theoretical optimizations (constraint solving, graph algorithms), not heuristic proxy rules. The research contribution lies in the question of whether this **compiler-driven runtime optimization** offers advantages over **proxy-driven runtime orchestration** (Service Mesh).

For systematic processing of this research question, four sub-questions are formulated:

1. **Metamodel Elements**: Which M3 model elements are necessary to describe process communication (dependencies, data flows, latency requirements)?

2. **IPC Derivation**: How can the M2-SDK compiler derive optimal IPC mechanisms from process dependencies? Which heuristics determine whether Pipe (same host, low overhead), Unix Socket (same host, higher flexibility), TCP (remote, highest flexibility), File-Queue (asynchronous, persistent), or Thread-Messaging (same process, lowest latency) is chosen?

3. **Positioning Metrics**: Which metrics determine the positioning of microservices (same container, same host, same cluster node, remote)? How are latency requirements (cf. Vogel-Heuser et al., 2024 for model-driven latency analysis of distributed skills), resource availability, and fault tolerance weighted?

4. **Scalability**: How does the Process-Group-Protocol under OPC UA behave with more than 50,000 devices? Can hierarchical grouping (Edge-Groups → Cluster-Groups → Global) achieve linear scaling behavior?

For validation of the research hypothesis, four testable hypotheses are established:

- **H1 (Latency)**: Compiler-based IPC optimization has the potential to significantly reduce latency compared to runtime service mesh solutions (to be measured in Phase 5). Li et al. (2019) show that Istio Service Mesh causes 5-10ms latency overhead per request, caused by sidecar proxies (~0.2 vCPU per sidecar, 50-80 MB memory) with **dynamic routing** and **service discovery at runtime**. VIA also uses Kubernetes Sidecars as IPC executors, but these execute **statically compiled communication paths**: The VIA compiler calculates optimal IPC mechanisms at runtime (but through compiler algorithms, not proxy heuristics) and generates **dedicated, optimized sidecars** without generic routing overhead. Through direct use of Unix Domain Sockets (~20-50μs latency, Stevens & Rago, 2013) for local communication instead of TCP-based Envoy routing, VIA achieves potentially 100-500x lower latency for intra-host communication.
- **H2 (Efficiency)**: Compiler-calculated positioning decisions (executed at M0 runtime, but through compiler algorithms instead of heuristics) can outperform proxy-based runtime orchestration under defined constraints. **Incremental recompilation** (only changed modules + dependency chains) enables rapid adaptation without complete system rebuild. Trade-off analysis required: Recompilation overhead vs. proxy routing overhead.
- **H3 (Scalability)**: The Process-Group-Protocol with hierarchical grouping should scale to at least 100,000 services (simulation-based validation)
- **H4 (Development Time)**: Metamodel-based abstraction should measurably reduce manual development time (comparative study required)

**Note**: Performance metrics will be determined empirically in Phase 5 (Evaluation). The target values mentioned in Section 7.3.2 are project goals, not validated measured results.

**Note on Research Focus**: The VIA overall system is a multi-year project (see Section 8) with numerous sub-components. This exposé describes the **overall vision and architecture** of the system. Specific research works (e.g., dissertations, master's theses) focus on **specific subsystems** – for these, **separate, focused exposés** are created (see separate documents for Process-Group-Protocol, M3-Compiler, Deployment-System, etc.).

### 2.3 Sub-problems of the Overall System (Context)

The VIA overall system is structured into eight sub-problems documented in the project structure under `playbooks/` as separate implementation playbooks. While this work focuses on the Process-Group-Protocol (2.3.5), understanding all components is necessary as they form the execution environment for process communication.

#### 2.3.0 Main Program (Orchestration M3→M2→M1)

**Project Location**: `src/main.cpp` (versioned, not in gitignore)

A detailed input/output specification of the main program is provided in Section 6.0.

The VIA main program orchestrates the entire bootstrap cycle through sequential compilation and testing of the compiler stages:

1. **M3-Compiler-Build**: Compiles `playbooks/VIA-M3-Compiler/` via CMake → `build/via-m3-compiler` binary
2. **M3-Compiler-Test**: Executes M3 test framework, validates AAS-lang parsing
3. **M2-SDK-Generation**: Executes `via-m3-compiler` → generates `playbooks/VIA-M2-SDK/` (gitignored)
4. **M2-SDK-Build**: Compiles generated SDK → `build/via-m2-sdk-compiler` binary
5. **Customer-Project-Compilation**: Loads customer project files (`.via` format), compiles with M2-SDK → `playbooks/VIA-M1-System/` (gitignored, C++ complete project)
6. **M1-System-Build**: Compiles M1 project for all target architectures → `build/binaries/{arch}/` folder
7. **Deployment**: Distributes binaries via Horse-Rider architecture to edge devices
8. **Server Mode**: Switches to OPC UA server mode, accepts recompilation requests from administrators

**Self-Reference Mechanism**: Upon recompilation request, the main program recompiles itself (M3→M2→M1→M0), starts new VIA instance via process communication, and terminates itself after successful handover.

**Multi-Level Debugging and Error Traceability**: When an error occurs in a process chain of the M0-compiled system, the main program maintains a comprehensive tracing model across all compilation stages. This enables seamless tracing of an error from the deployed binary (M0) through the system project (M1), the generated SDK (M2) back to the original M3 model definition and customer project definition. Since each lower meta-level is an implementation of a higher meta-level, a complete conceptual representation emerges across all layers. The VIA debugger can penetrate backwards through multiple layers and maintains multiple program counters simultaneously, spanning across various model files (`.aas`, `.via`) and generated C++ source files – analogous to the gdb debugger, which can also debug across multiple layers of the g++ compiler architecture (Frontend → Middle-End → Backend → Assembly → Binary). This multi-level debugging capability is essential for the maintainability of industrial systems, as errors can be traced directly to their conceptual cause in the metamodel specification, rather than analyzing only symptoms in the generated code.

**Problem**: State management across 3 phases, error handling at each stage, transactionality during self-recompilation, overhead of multi-level tracing in production systems

#### 2.3.1 M3 Level (Metamodel Compiler)

The M3 compiler, located in `playbooks/VIA-M3-Compiler/` as a versioned component of the repository, defines AAS-lang (Asset Administration Shell Language) as a domain-specific programming language (DSL, cf. Fowler, 2010; Völter et al., 2019 for Safety-Critical DSL Design) for industrial systems. This compiler component forms the first stage of the VIA compiler chain and is responsible for transforming abstract metamodel definitions (M3) into a type-safe C++ SDK (M2).

The M3 compiler receives as input the AAS IEC 63278 text specification, which is automatically transformed into executable M3 model code via the SITL system (Software-in-the-Loop). Additionally, it processes OPC UA IEC 62541 as an M3 library, also read via SITL if not yet present, as well as VIA extensions for process communication as custom M3 definitions. These inputs form the formal foundation for the subsequent SDK generation.

Processing is performed through a custom template engine defined in AAS-lang itself and built on C++20/23 metaprogramming. Protobuf from the `third_party/` directory serves as the M3 interpreter, used for reading model and customer data. An integrated constraint system validates type safety and prevents the creation of spaghetti code through rigorous modularization of the generated SDK.

As output, the M3 compiler generates the directory `playbooks/VIA-M2-SDK/` with complete C++ SDK code (gitignored, as generated), OPC UA NodeSet XML files for the VIA Custom Companion Specification, Protobuf `.proto` files for microservice communication between services, as well as comprehensive documentation with propagated M3 comments that reach the binary headers.

The central challenge of this component lies in avoiding spaghetti code during automatic code generation. This is addressed through a multi-layered constraint system that guarantees type safety, modularity, and maintainability of the generated SDK.

#### 2.3.2 M2 Level (SDK Compiler)

**Project Location**: `playbooks/VIA-M2-SDK/` (generated, gitignored)

The M2 SDK functions as a compiler for customer projects. It reads `.via` project files (written in AAS-lang), validates syntax, and compiles them into a complete C++ overall project (M1).

The planned playbook structure comprises four sub-components addressing various aspects of SDK functionality. The `network_discovery.md` playbook describes an SNMP/OPC UA/Modbus scanner for automatic topology detection in the customer network. The `ipc_optimizer.md` playbook implements a graph-based algorithm for IPC mechanism selection and forms the research focus of this work. The `auto_suggestions.md` playbook enables AI-supported suggestions for system configuration based on detected network topology. Finally, `test_generator.md` defines automatic generation of deterministic tests from M3 constraints to ensure complete test coverage.

As input, the M2 SDK receives customer project files in `.via` format under `customer_project/*.via` as well as optionally a network topology determined via the Network Discovery System. Processing these inputs results in three main outputs: The directory `playbooks/VIA-M1-System/` contains the complete C++ overall project (gitignored, as generated), Kubernetes manifests are provided as `deployment.yaml`, and automatically generated tests contain propagated customer comments for complete traceability.

The central challenge of this component lies in deterministic test coverage for industrial combinatorics as well as IPC optimization for more than 50,000 services, requiring scalable algorithms and efficient heuristics.

#### 2.3.3 M1 Level (System Deployment)

**Project Location**: `playbooks/VIA-M1-System-Deploy/` (Playbooks for deployment logic)

The M1 deployer compiles the M1 system project (C++ code) into binaries for all target architectures and distributes them via the Horse-Rider deployment system.

The architecture comprises three sub-components covering various deployment aspects. The `cross_compilation.md` playbook describes multi-architecture toolchain management for MIPS, RISC-V, ARM, x86, and other platforms, thereby addressing heterogeneous industrial environments with legacy systems. The `horse_rider_deployment.md` playbook implements C++23 Modules with stable ABIs, hot-reload mechanisms, and canary deployment for failure-safe updates. The `distributed_build.md` playbook orchestrates parallel builds via GitHub Runners to significantly reduce compilation time for large systems.

The M1 deployer generates three categories of outputs. The compiled binaries are stored architecture-specifically in the folder structure `build/binaries/{arch}/{device_id}/`, with each edge device receiving its dedicated binary. Deployment manifests for Kubernetes and edge devices enable automated rollouts via container orchestration. Versioned binaries with header documentation allow external edge programming by third-party systems that can link against stable VIA ABIs.

The central challenges of this component lie in hot-reload without system failure, canary deployment with automatic rollback on errors, version consistency for C++23 Modules across multiple compiler generations, as well as ABI stability for long-term industrial compatibility (typically 15-25 years).

#### 2.3.4 Deployment System (Horse-Rider Architecture)

**Project Location**: Part of `playbooks/VIA-M1-System-Deploy/horse_rider_deployment.md`

The Horse-Rider architecture decouples deployment logic (Horse) from business logic (Rider) through modular separation of responsibilities. The Horse service functions as a stable container that dynamically loads and unloads Rider services as C++23 Modules at runtime, enabling hot-reload without system failure. During a Rider update, the Horse first checks the ABI compatibility of the new module against the defined interfaces. Subsequently, it loads the new module in parallel to the old one (canary deployment) and initially routes only a small percentage of traffic to the new service. Upon successful canary test, complete traffic switching to the new Rider occurs, while in case of errors, automatic rollback to the old module is performed. The architecture provides for at least two parallel Horses per edge device, which function as a digital twin and ensure mutual redundancy.

The central technical challenges of this architecture lie in ABI stability for C++23 Modules across multiple compiler versions and update cycles, in state synchronization during hot-reload between old and new Rider service, as well as in rollback transactionality, which ensures that in case of errors, a consistent system state can be restored within fractions of a second.

#### 2.3.5 Sub-Protocols under OPC UA → **RESEARCH FOCUS**

**Project Location**: `playbooks/VIA-M3-Compiler/via_protocols/` (future, specification still open)

VIA defines three custom OPC UA sub-protocols as a systematic extension of the standard, addressing various aspects of system orchestration. The Edge-Group-Protocol enables virtual network groups for hierarchical edge device grouping, thereby achieving scalability to more than 50,000 devices. The Deploy-Protocol manages versioning, logging, and rejuvenation for the Horse-Rider system to ensure failure-safe updates. The Process-Group-Protocol forms the core of this research work and optimizes IPC mechanisms between services through automatic selection between Pipe, Unix Socket, TCP, File-Queue, and Thread-Messaging based on process dependencies and latency requirements.

The implementation of these protocols occurs as an M3 library (`via_protocols` lib) within AAS-lang, enabling them to be processed by the VIA-M3 compiler and integrated into the M2 SDK. The planned MMB integration (Multi-Message Broker according to Santiago Soler Perez Olaya) enables many-to-many broadcast communication for flexible message distribution between heterogeneous process groups.

The current status of this component is the specification phase; the concrete protocol definitions will be elaborated as M3 models during the further project course. The central challenges lie in protocol composition of various sub-protocols without semantic conflicts, in efficiency for more than 50,000 devices through hierarchical grouping, in definition of nested security layers, as well as in future standardization by the OPC Foundation as an official Companion Specification.

#### 2.3.6 Network Discovery System

**Project Location**: Part of `playbooks/VIA-M2-SDK/network_discovery.md`

The Network Discovery System performs automatic scanning of the customer network by systematically employing various industrial protocols such as SNMP, OPC UA, Modbus, MQTT, and RPC for topology detection. The system reads device properties from PLCs, SCADA systems, MES servers, and sensors, classifies them automatically, and creates a structured network topology. Based on this analysis, the system generates asset mapping suggestions for the M2 project configuration, which serve the user as a starting point for further system definition.

The essential challenges of this component lie in the protocol heterogeneity of various industrial standards with different data models and communication patterns, in access control to safety-critical production systems without existing credentials, as well as in handling offline devices that are not reachable at scan time but must nevertheless be integrated into the topology.

#### 2.3.7 Master Active Management (Deployment Orchestration)

**Project Location**: Part of `playbooks/VIA-M1-System-Deploy/master_active_management.md`

The Master Active Management implements Active/Active redundancy analogous to Microsoft Active Directory, where multiple deployment masters are simultaneously active and replicate each other (based on consensus algorithms such as Paxos, Lamport, 1998; or Raft, Ongaro & Ousterhout, 2014). The deployment master coordinates both Kubernetes container orchestration (Burns & Oppenheimer, 2016) as well as edge service orchestration for non-containerized devices, thereby forming the central control instance of the VIA system. Access control is managed via a role-based permission system that defines users and roles and can optionally be integrated with existing Samba or Active Directory infrastructures. The configuration of redundancy levels and service distribution occurs through policies that determine how many replicas of each service are deployed on which hosts.

The critical challenges of this component lie in avoiding split-brain scenarios where separated master instances make inconsistent decisions, in ensuring consistency across geographically distributed clusters, as well as in minimizing failover times when a master fails to guarantee continuous orchestration.

#### 2.3.8 Multi-Architecture Cross-Compilation

**Project Location**: Part of `playbooks/VIA-M1-System-Deploy/cross_compilation.md`

The Multi-Architecture Cross-Compilation System enables support for heterogeneous hardware platforms, including MIPS, RISC-V, POWER9+, x86, ARM1+, and Sparc, each on operating systems such as Linux, Windows, and macOS. The M2 SDK customer defines the desired target architectures declaratively in `.via` project files, whereupon the M1 deployer automatically configures CMake toolchains for all targets and performs parallel cross-compilation. This architectural diversity enables legacy support for old industrial systems that have been in production for decades in some cases, as well as simultaneous integration of modern architectures for new components.

The essential challenges of this component lie in toolchain management for a multitude of compiler versions and target platforms, in driver availability for specific hardware components on legacy systems, as well as in the different memory models of various architectures (e.g., big-endian vs. little-endian, different pointer sizes), which require consistent data serialization and IPC communication across architecture boundaries.

## 3. State of Research

The research builds upon several established standards and research results, which are systematically presented in the following. The analysis encompasses Robot Operating System (ROS) as a related approach (Section 3.0), AAS code generation (Section 3.1), OPC UA as communication protocol (Section 3.2), Multi-Message Broker for brownfield integration (Section 3.3), management frameworks (Section 3.4), service-oriented architectures (Section 3.5), monitoring approaches (Section 3.6), as well as theoretical foundations such as ISA-95 and CMFM (Section 3.7).

### 3.0 Robot Operating System (ROS) - Related Architecture and Potential VIA Integration

The Robot Operating System (ROS) represents a significant related architecture that exhibits fundamental parallels to the VIA system conception. ROS was primarily developed for robotics, yet addresses similar challenges in the orchestration of distributed, heterogeneous systems as VIA does for industrial automation.

#### 3.0.1 ROS Architecture: Multi-Layer Abstraction

ROS implements a **three-layer abstraction architecture** (Quigley et al., 2009) that exhibits conceptual similarities to the VIA M3/M2/M1 structure:

1. **Filesystem Level**: Organization of software into packages, metapackages, and message/service definitions – analogous to the VIA M3 metamodel level as structural foundation
2. **Computation Graph Level**: Peer-to-peer network of nodes (processes) with topics (publish/subscribe) and services (request/reply) – comparable to VIA M2 SDK as compilation level for process communication
3. **Community Level**: Distributions, repositories, and collaborative development – similar to the VIA M1 deployment level with versioned binaries and community contributions

**Essential Difference**: ROS abstraction levels are primarily **organizational and effective at runtime**, while VIA implements a **complete compiler chain M3→M2→M1** that transforms metamodels into optimized machine code.

#### 3.0.2 ROS Process Communication vs. VIA Process-Group-Protocol

**ROS Communication Mechanisms** (Quigley et al., 2009):
- **Topics**: Asynchronous publish/subscribe communication for many-to-many data streams
- **Services**: Synchronous request/reply interaction for direct client-server communication
- **Actions**: Asynchronous request/reply with feedback for long-running operations
- **Parameter Server**: Central key-value store for configuration data

**VIA Process-Group-Protocol**:
- **IPC Mechanism Selection at Compile-Time**: Automatic choice between Pipe, Unix Socket, TCP, File-Queue, and Thread-Messaging based on process dependencies and latency requirements
- **Pareto Optimization**: Multi-objective optimization for latency, throughput, and resource consumption using constraint solver (Z3)
- **Hierarchical Grouping**: Edge-Group-Protocol for scaling to >50,000 devices through virtual network groups

**Core Difference**: ROS makes IPC decisions at **runtime** through DDS QoS policies (Data Distribution Service Quality of Service), while VIA performs **compile-time optimization** that utilizes static analysis of the metamodel.

#### 3.0.3 ROS2 and DDS Middleware Abstraction

ROS2 (current version, Macenski et al., 2022) is based on **DDS (Data Distribution Service)** (OMG, 2015) as middleware and implements a **ROS Middleware Interface (RMW)** abstraction layer that abstracts various DDS implementations (FastDDS, CycloneDDS, RTI Connext). This architecture shows parallels to the VIA Multi-Message Broker (MMB, Soler Perez Olaya et al., 2024), which abstracts heterogeneous brownfield protocols (Modbus, PROFIBUS, EtherCAT) via AID/AIMC mapping.

**Architecture Comparison**:
```
ROS2-Stack:                     VIA-Stack:
+--------------------+          +---------------------+
| ROS Client Library |          | VIA M2-SDK          |
+--------------------+          +---------------------+
| RMW (Middleware)   |          | MMB (M3-Bibliothek) |
+--------------------+          +---------------------+
| DDS Implementation |          | OPC UA + Protocols  |
+--------------------+          +---------------------+
```

**Essential Difference**: The RMW layer is a **runtime abstraction** for interchangeable middleware implementations, while the VIA MMB is defined as an **M3 library** in the metamodel and is integrated into the M2 SDK at compile-time.

#### 3.0.4 ROS Cross-Compilation vs. VIA Multi-Arch Deployment

**ROS2 Approach**: ROS2 has abandoned native `cross_compile` tool support and instead relies on **Docker buildx** for multi-platform images. This shows a pragmatic shift from native cross-compilation to container-based deployment. The focus is on **homogeneous cloud-native environments** with container orchestration through Kubernetes.

**VIA Approach**: VIA pursues a **hybrid deployment approach** with three equal objectives:

1. **Native Multi-Architecture Cross-Compilation** (MIPS, RISC-V, ARM, x86, POWER9, Sparc)
   - CMake toolchains for each target architecture
   - Compiler-supported ABI stability across compiler generations
   - **Bare-metal deployment** on edge devices without OS overhead (~250KB footprint)
   - **Legacy support** for 15-25 year old industrial systems without container infrastructure

2. **Docker Container Deployment**
   - VIA M1 compiler generates **Dockerfiles** for each target architecture
   - Multi-stage builds for minimal image size
   - Docker Compose for local multi-service orchestration
   - Compatible with existing Docker infrastructures

3. **Kubernetes-Native Deployment**
   - VIA M1 compiler generates **Kubernetes manifests** (Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps)
   - Helm charts for parameterizable deployments
   - Canary deployment and rolling updates via K8s
   - **Horse-Rider deployment**: Hot-reload through K8s pod rotation

**Core Difference**: While ROS2 has focused on **container-only**, VIA retains **native cross-compilation** and offers it as an **equal alternative** alongside container deployment. This is crucial for:

- **Brownfield Integration**: Old PLCs (MIPS, PowerPC) without virtualization
- **Edge Devices with Limited Resources**: <1GB RAM, no container runtime
- **Deterministic Real-Time Requirements**: Bare-metal for <1ms latency
- **Safety-Critical Systems**: Minimal attack surface without container daemon

**Architecture Comparison**:
```
ROS2 (Container-only):                  VIA (Hybrid):
┌──────────────────────┐                ┌──────────────────────────┐

                                        │       └─ Helm Chart      │
                                        └──────────────────────────┘
```

This **deployment flexibility** is a unique selling point of VIA compared to ROS2 and enables deployment in **heterogeneous Industry 4.0 environments** with a mix of legacy hardware and modern cloud infrastructure.

#### 3.0.5 ROS as VIA Subsystem: Possible Integration

A central insight of this analysis is that **ROS systems can in principle be described through VIA M3 definitions** and **robots can be integrated as edge devices/edge groups** into the VIA architecture. This would make ROS a **subsystem of the VIA overall system**:

**Integration Scenario 1: ROS Nodes as VIA Processes**
- ROS nodes are defined as VIA processes in the M3 metamodel
- ROS topics/services are mapped to VIA Process-Group-Protocol
- The VIA M2 compiler generates optimized IPC mechanisms (e.g., shared memory instead of DDS for local nodes)

**Integration Scenario 2: ROS Robots as Edge Groups**
- Each robot or robot fleet forms a VIA Edge-Group (Edge-Group-Protocol)
- The VIA Deploy-Protocol manages versioning and updates for ROS packages
- The VIA Master Active Management coordinates robot orchestration via Kubernetes + edge devices

**Integration Scenario 3: ROS Messages as M3 Datatypes**
- ROS `.msg`/`.srv` definitions are automatically transformed into AAS-lang M3 model elements (SITL)
- The VIA M3 compiler generates both ROS-compatible message classes and optimized Protobuf definitions
- Existing ROS systems can be incrementally migrated into VIA deployments

**Scientific Added Value of this Integration**:
1. **Unified Semantics**: ROS and industrial automation (AAS, OPC UA) share a common M3 metamodel
2. **Optimized Performance**: ROS systems benefit from VIA compile-time IPC optimization
3. **Scalability**: ROS master limitations (typically 100-1,000 nodes) are overcome through VIA hierarchical grouping (>50,000 devices)
4. **Standards Compliance**: ROS robots communicate with MES/ERP systems via standardized OPC UA interfaces

**Delimitation**: The concrete implementation of ROS-VIA integration is not part of this research work but is outlined as a **future extension** (post-dissertation).

#### 3.0.6 Application Domain Demarcation: VIA vs. ROS

Despite architectural similarities, ROS and VIA address **fundamentally different application domains** that require different optimization strategies:

**ROS Domain: Robotics and Autonomous Systems**
- **Dynamic, Unstructured Environments**: Mobile robots (navigation, SLAM), manipulators (motion planning, MoveIt), autonomous vehicles (sensor fusion, object recognition), humanoid robots (balance control), drones (swarm coordination)
- **Prototyping and Research**: Rapid iteration, reuse of community packages (>3,000 ROS packages), experimental algorithms
- **Soft Real-Time Requirements**: 10Hz-100Hz control loops for motion control, adaptive planning based on sensors
- **Typical System Size**: 10-1,000 nodes per robot, 1-100 robots per fleet
- **Runtime Flexibility**: Runtime optimization through DDS QoS policies, dynamic node composition, service discovery

**VIA Domain: Static Factory Information Systems (Industry 4.0)**
- **Fixed Production Lines**: SCADA systems (process visualization, alarming), MES integration (production orders, OEE), PLC edge networking (robot arms, conveyors, test stations), ERP integration (order data flow, warehouse management)
- **Long-Term Maintenance and Compliance**: 15-25 years production lifetime, version consistency, audit trails, standards compliance (IEC 63278 AAS, IEC 62541 OPC UA)
- **Hard Real-Time Requirements**: <1ms latency for process control, deterministic process chains without adaptive planning
- **Typical System Size**: 100-50,000+ edge devices per factory (e.g., automotive production with multiple plants)
- **Compile-Time Efficiency**: Static topologies enable Pareto optimization at compilation, IPC mechanism selection without runtime overhead

**Capability Overlap Matrix**:

| Capability | ROS | VIA | Overlap |
|-----------|-----|-----|---------|
| **Multi-Platform-Deployment** | Container-only (Docker buildx) | Native + Docker + K8s | ✅ Partial |
| **IPC-Optimierung** | Runtime (DDS QoS) | Compile-Time (Pareto) | ✅ Conceptual |
| **Middleware-Abstraktion** | RMW (Runtime) | MMB (M3-Bibliothek) | ✅ Architectural |
| **Composition** | Intra-Process (Runtime) | Process-Group-Protocol (Compile-Time) | ✅ Similar Goal |
| **Discovery** | DDS Auto-Discovery | OPC UA Discovery + Registry | ✅ Similar Mechanism |
| **Legacy-Support** | ❌ Container-only | ✅ Native Bare-Metal | ❌ VIA-Only |
| **Dynamic Environments** | ✅ Robotics Focus | ❌ Static Factories | ❌ ROS-Only |
| **Standards-Compliance** | ROS-native Standards | IEC 63278, IEC 62541 | ❌ Different Standards |
| **Real-Time** | Soft Real-Time | Hard Real-Time | ✅ Partial |
| **Scalability** | 10-1,000 Nodes | 50,000+ Devices | ✅ Different Scale |

**Core Difference Summary**: ROS optimizes for **runtime flexibility** in dynamic, unstructured robotics scenarios, while VIA optimizes for **compile-time efficiency** in static, structured factory environments. Both approaches are optimal for their respective domains but not directly interchangeable.

#### 3.0.7 Relevance for this Work

The ROS architecture demonstrates the **feasibility of metamodel-based abstraction** for complex distributed systems and validates central VIA design decisions:
- **Multi-layered abstraction** is proven in practice (ROS: >10 years production deployment, Quigley et al. 2009)
- **Middleware abstraction** (RMW) shows that heterogeneous implementations can be integrated under a unified API (Macenski et al. 2022)
- **Community-driven development** (>3,000 ROS packages) demonstrates scalability of open ecosystems

The essential **research gap** that VIA addresses lies in the **compile-time optimization of IPC mechanisms** – an aspect that ROS does not systematically investigate. This work contributes to closing the gap between ROS-like flexibility and industrial performance requirements.

### 3.1 Asset Administration Shell (AAS) - aas-core-works

The aas-core-works framework forms the conceptual starting point for metamodel-based code generation in VIA. It implements the IEC 63278 standard as an M3/M2/M1 Metamodel Architecture for digital twins and demonstrates how production-ready code for six target languages can be generated from an abstract metamodel (aas-core-meta in simplified Python). The architecture follows the single-source-of-truth principle: The M3 metamodel is defined once canonically, and the aas-core-codegen compiler automatically transforms it into language-specific SDKs with identical semantics.

**VIA Project Integration**: VIA adopts the M3/M2/M1 architecture idea but implements an independent M3 compiler in `playbooks/VIA-M3-Compiler/` that interprets AAS IEC 63278 as M3 model code. The textual specification (PDF/HTML of IEC 63278) is automatically transformed into executable M3 code via SITL (Software-in-the-Loop), which is processed by the VIA-M3 compiler. The 6 language SDKs from aas-core-codegen serve as reference implementation, but VIA initially focuses on C++ SDK generation with its own template engine (defined in AAS-lang itself, not in Python). Unlike aas-core-works, which uses Python scripts for code generation, the VIA-M3 compiler is a production-ready C++20/23 compiler with complete test framework and stable binary distribution.

The aas-core-works framework (aas-core-works, 2024) implements the IEC 63278 standard (IEC 63278-1:2024), which defines an M3/M2/M1 Metamodel Architecture for Digital Twins (cf. also Barnstedt et al., 2022 for Metamodel Evolution). The aas-core-meta repository contains the M3 metamodel in simplified Python as canonical definition, with releases versioned according to the schema YYYY.MM.DD. The aas-core-codegen multi-target compiler follows the single source of truth principle and enables automated generation with focus on scalability.

The framework generates six language SDKs (C++, C#, Python, TypeScript, Java, Golang) with identical semantics as well as five schema exports (JSON Schema, XSD, RDF SHACL, JSON-LD Context, Protobuf). The code generation pipeline transforms the Python M3 metamodel via parser and analyzer into language-specific SDKs and schema exports. The transformation rules map Python classes to target language classes, properties are transformed into getters/setters, constraints are translated into validation functions, and documentation is automatically propagated into API documentation.

The constraint system uses Python `@invariant` decorators for runtime validation, validating uniqueness, multiplicity, type safety, and semantic consistency. Code injection points enable custom constructors, serialization/deserialization, and performance optimizations at defined locations in the generated code. The community comprises 2.9K stars and 307 contributors, the project is licensed under MPL 2.0.

The limitations of the framework lie in the use of Python scripts instead of a C++ production compiler, the model being static without runtime reconfiguration, and the implementation being AAS-specific without consideration of industrial real-time constraints.

### 3.2 OPC UA (IEC 62541) & open62541 C99 Stack

OPC UA (Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture) according to IEC 62541 (IEC 62541-1:2020; Cavalieri & Chiacchio, 2013 for specification analysis) forms the communication backbone for VIA. As an established standard in industrial automation, OPC UA offers M3/M2/M1-based information modeling (Hofer, 2009) that is structurally compatible with the VIA architecture. The open62541 implementation (open62541, 2024) – originally a TU Dresden research project – delivers a production-ready C99 stack with minimal memory footprint (~250KB, cf. Imtiaz & Jasperneite, 2013 for embedded scalability) suitable for edge devices. Particularly relevant for VIA is the Dynamic Address Space API, which enables creating and deleting OPC UA nodes at runtime – a prerequisite for mapping dynamically registering VIA processes.

**VIA Project Integration**: OPC UA is defined in VIA exclusively at M3 level as a library. The textual specification of OPC UA IEC 62541 is transformed via SITL into M3 model code and integrated as an M3 library in `playbooks/VIA-M3-Compiler/third_party/opcua_m3/`. The VIA-M3 compiler generates from these M3 models both OPC UA NodeSet XML files (VIA Custom Companion Spec) in `playbooks/VIA-M3-Compiler/output/via_companion_spec.xml` as well as the complete OPC UA implementation for the M2 SDK. VIA does not use external M2 libraries like open62541 directly, but generates all OPC UA functionality from the M3 metamodel. The open62541 C99 implementation serves merely as a reference and proof that the OPC UA specification is correctly implementable in embedded systems. The SDK generated by VIA implements the Dynamic Address Space API analogous to `UA_Server_addObjectNode()` for dynamic registration of processes at runtime – a hybrid model of static type definitions (VIAProcessType, VIARouterType) and dynamic instances.

#### 3.2.1 OPC UA as Standardized Communication Protocol

OPC UA (Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture) according to IEC 62541 (IEC 62541-1:2020; Cavalieri & Chiacchio, 2013) forms the fundamental **communication backbone** for VIA and is the central standard for industrial interoperability in Industry 4.0 environments. Unlike proprietary protocols, OPC UA offers a platform-independent, service-oriented architecture with clearly defined specification across all layers.

**IEC 62541 Standard Structure**: The standard is divided into 14 parts that completely define all aspects of the protocol:

- **Part 1: Overview and Concepts** – Architecture overview, fundamental concepts
- **Part 2: Security Model** – Encryption, authentication, certificates
- **Part 3: Address Space Model** – Object model, references, namespaces
- **Part 4: Services** – 37 Service Sets (Read, Write, Browse, Call, Subscribe, etc.)
- **Part 5: Information Model** – Standard types (BaseObjectType, BaseVariableType)
- **Part 6: Mappings** – Binary Encoding, JSON Encoding, Transport (UA-TCP, HTTPS)
- **Part 7: Profiles** – Conformance levels (Nano, Micro, Embedded, Standard, Advanced)
- **Part 8: Data Access** – AnalogItemType, DiscreteItemType, DataChangeNotifications
- **Part 9: Alarms & Conditions** – Event system, AlarmTypes, AcknowledgeableConditionType
- **Part 10: Programs** – ProgramStateMachineType, program orchestration
- **Part 11: Historical Access** – Archiving, trending, HistoricalDataConfiguration
- **Part 12: Discovery** – Multicast discovery, Local Discovery Server (LDS), Global Discovery Server (GDS)
- **Part 13: Aggregates** – Statistical functions (Average, Min, Max, Count)
- **Part 14: PubSub** – Publisher/Subscriber model (UDP, MQTT, AMQP)

This **complete specification** of all protocol layers distinguishes OPC UA from fragmented standards (e.g., Modbus with unofficial extensions) and makes it the ideal foundation for VIA's **compile-time Protocol Generation**.

#### 3.2.2 OPC UA Architecture Layers and Protocol Stack

OPC UA defines a **multi-layered protocol stack** that cleanly separates responsibilities between layers:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Application Layer (Part 4: Services)    │
│  ├─ Read/Write/Browse Services          │
│  ├─ Method Call Services                │
│  ├─ Subscription Services               │
│  └─ Session Management                  │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Information Model (Part 3/5)            │
│  ├─ Address Space (Nodes, References)   │
│  ├─ ObjectTypes, VariableTypes          │
│  └─ Namespace Management                │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Encoding Layer (Part 6)                 │
│  ├─ Binary Encoding (efficient)         │
│  ├─ JSON Encoding (web-friendly)        │
│  └─ XML Encoding (legacy)               │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Secure Channel (Part 2/6)               │
│  ├─ Encryption (AES-128, AES-256)       │
│  ├─ Signing (SHA1, SHA256)              │
│  └─ Key Exchange (RSA-2048)             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Transport Layer (Part 6)                │
│  ├─ UA Binary Protocol (opc.tcp://)     │
│  ├─ HTTPS (reverse proxy-friendly)      │
│  └─ WebSockets (browser-compatible)     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**VIA Relevance**: This layering enables **selective code generation** – the VIA-M3 compiler can generate only necessary layers for embedded systems (e.g., Binary Encoding + UA-TCP without JSON/HTTPS), while all layers are activated for cloud gateways.

#### 3.2.3 Client-Server Model and Many-to-Many Communication

OPC UA implements a **client-server model** with flexible topology:

- **One server can serve multiple clients simultaneously** (up to configured limit, typically 10-500 sessions)
- **One client can communicate with multiple servers in parallel** (aggregation scenarios)
- **Server-to-server communication** possible through dual-role (Server A as client to Server B)

**Discovery Mechanisms** (IEC 62541-12):

1. **Local Discovery Server (LDS)**: Central registry for servers in the local network
2. **Multicast Discovery**: UDP-based broadcast search (for automatic network exploration)
3. **Global Discovery Server (GDS)**: Cross-regional server registry with certificate management

**VIA Network Discovery Integration**: The `playbooks/VIA-M2-SDK/network_discovery.md` module utilizes OPC UA Discovery for automatic detection of:
- Existing VIA processes in the network
- OPC UA-capable legacy devices (e.g., modern PLCs with built-in OPC UA servers)
- Brownfield assets with MMB gateway (see Section 3.3)

The detected devices are automatically suggested in `.via` project files, with the VIA-M2 compiler deriving the optimal communication topology.

#### 3.2.4 Information Modeling: Address Space and Metamodel Compatibility

The **OPC UA Address Space Model** (IEC 62541-3) forms the heart of interoperability and shows structural similarity to the VIA M3/M2/M1 architecture:

**Address Space Concepts**:

- **Nodes**: Fundamental units (Objects, Variables, Methods, Views, ObjectTypes, VariableTypes, DataTypes, ReferenceTypes)
- **References**: Typed relationships between nodes (Hierarchical: HasComponent, Organizes; Non-Hierarchical: HasTypeDefinition, HasModellingRule)
- **Namespaces**: Versioned model spaces (Namespace 0 = OPC UA Standard, Namespace 1+ = Custom Models)

**Object Orientation**:

- **Type Hierarchy**: Inheritance from BaseObjectType/BaseVariableType (analogous to OOP classes)
- **Instantiation**: TypeDefinition → Instance object (analogous to class → instance)
- **Polymorphism**: Subtype compatibility (client can work with BaseType, even if server provides subtype)

**M3/M2/M1 Mapping to OPC UA**:

```
VIA Level          OPC UA Concept              Example
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
M3 (Metamodel)     BaseObjectType              Object, Variable, Method
                   BaseVariableType
                   Base ReferenceType          HasComponent, Organizes
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
M2 (Model)         Custom ObjectTypes          VIAProcessType (extends DeviceType)
                   Custom VariableTypes        VIAStateType (extends BaseDataVariableType)
                   Companion Specifications    VIA Custom Companion Spec
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
M1 (Instance)      Instance Objects            VIAProcess_42 (Instance of VIAProcessType)
                   Runtime Values              Temperature = 23.5°C
                   Method Calls                StartProcess(params)
```

**Dynamic Modeling**: OPC UA supports **Dynamic Address Space Updates** – nodes can be added/removed at runtime. This is essential for VIA, as processes dynamically register and deregister.

#### 3.2.5 open62541 C99 Stack – Embedded-Suitable Implementation

The **open62541 implementation** (open62541, 2024; originally TU Dresden research project) delivers a **production-ready C99 stack** with the following properties:

**Memory Footprint**:
- **Minimal Configuration** (~250 KB): Core + Namespace 0 MINIMAL (~100 Nodes)
- **Standard Configuration** (~500 KB): Core + Namespace 0 REDUCED (~500 Nodes)
- **Full Configuration** (~800 KB): Core + Namespace 0 FULL (~3000 Nodes) + Encryption (mbedTLS +300 KB)

**Platform Support**:
- **POSIX** (Linux, BSD, macOS, QNX)
- **Windows** (Win32 API)
- **Zephyr RTOS** (embedded)
- **Legacy**: freeRTOS, vxWorks, WEC7 (Windows Embedded Compact)

**Plugin Architecture**: Modular components interchangeable (analogous to VIA's Modular Design):
- **Logging**: stdout, syslog, custom backends
- **Crypto**: OpenSSL, mbedTLS, LibreSSL
- **Access Control**: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), custom authenticators
- **NodeStore**: HashMap (fast), ZipTree (memory-efficient)

**Performance Characteristics** (relevant for VIA's 50,000+ device scaling):
- **Single-threaded**: ~10,000 Read/Write ops/sec, ~1,000 Notifications/sec
- **Multi-threaded** (4 Cores): ~50,000 ops/sec (linear scaling)
- **Address Space Size**: Tested with up to 100,000 Nodes (HashMap NodeStore)
- **Concurrent Clients**: ~50 (single-threaded), ~500 (multi-threaded, hardware-dependent)

**Nodeset Compiler**: Python-based tool (`nodeset_compiler.py`) for transforming OPC UA XML NodeSets into C code – **directly compatible** with VIA's code generation pipeline (see Section 3.2.6).

#### 3.2.6 VIA Project Integration and Code Generation Pipeline

**M3 Level as Base Library**: OPC UA is defined in VIA **exclusively at M3 level as a library**. The textual specification of IEC 62541 (PDF/HTML) is transformed into executable M3 model code via **SITL (Software-in-the-Loop)** and integrated into `playbooks/VIA-M3-Compiler/third_party/opcua_m3/`.

```
Stage 1: VIA M3 Metamodel → OPC UA NodeSet XML
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
VIA-M3-Compiler reads: VIA process definitions (.via files)
                       AAS submodels (M3 library)
                       CMFM management functions (M3 library)

Generates:             via_companion_spec.xml (OPC UA NodeSet 2.0)
                       ├─ VIAProcessType (extends DeviceType)
                       ├─ VIARouterType (extends BaseObjectType)
                       ├─ VIASchedulerType (extends BaseObjectType)
                       └─ VIARegistryType (extends BaseObjectType)

Stage 2: OPC UA NodeSet XML → C++ Code
────────────────────────────────────────
open62541 nodeset_compiler.py:
    Input:  via_companion_spec.xml + Opc.Ua.Di.NodeSet2.xml (DI Companion Spec)
    Output: via_nodeset.h / via_nodeset.c

Stage 3: Integration into VIA-M2-SDK
───────────────────────────────────────
VIA-M2-Compiler links: via_nodeset.c + open62541 library + VIA Process C++23 Modules
Deployment:            Native Binary (ARM/x86/MIPS) OR Docker Container OR K8s Pod
```

**No External M2 Library Dependency**: VIA uses **no** direct dependency on open62541 as an external M2 library. Instead:

1. **OPC UA Specification (IEC 62541) is modeled at M3 level** – The standard itself (14 Parts) is described in AAS-lang as M3 library
2. **VIA-M3 compiler generates OPC UA code** – Complete C++ code for OPC UA client/server is generated from the M3 model
3. **open62541 serves as reference implementation** – Proves that OPC UA is correctly implementable in embedded systems (250 KB footprint)
4. **Dynamic Address Space API** – VIA generates code analogous to `UA_Server_addObjectNode()` for dynamic process registration

**Hybrid Model** (Static + Dynamic):
- **Static type definitions**: VIAProcessType, VIARouterType (part of via_companion_spec.xml, generated once)
- **Dynamic instances**: VIAProcess_42 (created at runtime when process registers)

Example of dynamic registration (generated code):
```cpp
// VIA-M2-SDK: auto-generated from M3
void VIARegistry::registerProcess(const ProcessInfo& info) {
    UA_ObjectAttributes oAttr = UA_ObjectAttributes_default;
    oAttr.displayName = UA_LOCALIZEDTEXT("en-US", info.name.c_str());

    UA_NodeId processNodeId;
    UA_Server_addObjectNode(
        opcua_server_,
        UA_NODEID_NULL,  // Auto-generate NodeId
        UA_NODEID_NUMERIC(0, UA_NS0ID_OBJECTSFOLDER),
        UA_NODEID_NUMERIC(0, UA_NS0ID_ORGANIZES),
        UA_QUALIFIEDNAME(1, info.name.c_str()),
        UA_NODEID_NUMERIC(2, VIA_PROCESS_TYPE),  // From via_companion_spec
        oAttr,
        nullptr,
        &processNodeId
    );

    // Add process-specific variables (state, telemetry, etc.)
    // Add process-specific methods (start, stop, configure, etc.)
}
```

#### 3.2.7 Companion Specifications and VIA Custom Companion Spec

The **UA-Nodeset Repository** (OPC Foundation, 2024) offers over **76 Companion Specifications** that standardize domain-specific information models:

**Selected Companion Specs (relevant for VIA)**:
- **DI (Device Integration)**: Base model for devices (DeviceType, BlockType, ConfigurableObjectType)
- **I4AAS (Asset Administration Shell)**: OPC UA mapping of IEC 63278 AAS (see Section 3.1)
- **PLCopen**: Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC programs, function blocks)
- **ISA-95**: Enterprise-Control System Integration (production orders, material flow)
- **PackML**: Packaging Machine Language (state machines for packaging machines)

**Limitations of Traditional OPC UA Approaches**:
- **Static NodeSets**: Once generated, models are fixed → VIA resolves this through Dynamic Address Space API
- **No Orchestration**: OPC UA does not define automatic service composition → VIA adds Process-Group-Protocol
- **Runtime-Only Optimization**: No compile-time IPC selection → VIA's core research contribution (see Section 2.2)

### 3.3 Multi-Message Broker (Santiago Soler Perez Olaya et al., IEEE ETFA 2024)

The Multi-Message Broker (MMB, Soler Perez Olaya et al., 2024) addresses the challenge of brownfield integration: Legacy devices with proprietary, inflexible protocols (Modbus, PROFIBUS, EtherCAT) must be integrated into modern AAS-based Industry 4.0 systems. The MMB functions as a gateway between northbound interfaces (I4.0 HTTP API, future Type 3 Proactive AAS according to Plattform Industrie 4.0, 2023) and southbound protocols (Modbus, HTTP, MQTT, future PROFIBUS/EtherCAT/PROFINET). The architecture demonstrates how heterogeneous protocols can be systematically transformed into a unified AAS data model through mapping submodels (AID/AIMC according to Soler Perez Olaya et al., 2024) – an approach that VIA uses for automatic generation of protocol adapters.

**VIA Project Integration**: The MMB forms the **M3 model foundation and library** (`playbooks/VIA-M3-Compiler/third_party/mmb/`) for the three VIA sub-protocols under OPC UA. The MMB architecture is implemented at M3 level as a base library on which Edge-Group-Protocol, Deploy-Protocol, and Process-Group-Protocol build. These protocols are **virtually and dynamically mapped as MMB between processing groups onto OPC UA** – not statically at compile time, but dynamically adaptable at runtime.

The MMB concepts (AID/AIMC Mapping, Consistency Layer, Sync/Async Translation, Many-to-Many Broadcast) are used in two ways:
1. **Network Discovery** (`playbooks/VIA-M2-SDK/network_discovery.md`): Automatic detection of brownfield devices, AID extraction, AIMC mapping generation as `.via` project file suggestions
2. **Dynamic Protocol Orchestration**: The 3 sub-protocols organize themselves **separately from each other** in the overall network, form **nested and recursive security levels** in each protocol layer, and enable virtual network streams with different QoS guarantees (latency, packet arrival reliability, security levels).

The MMB addresses the problem of brownfield integration, where legacy devices with inflexible protocols must be integrated into modern systems. The MMB functions as a gateway with northbound interfaces (I4.0 HTTP API, future Type 3 Proactive AAS) and southbound protocols (Modbus, HTTP, MQTT, future PROFIBUS/EtherCAT/PROFINET).

The internal architecture comprises three layers: The Consistency Layer guarantees that identical requests return the same information, the Mapping Layer selects the appropriate connector and performs data transformation, and the AAS Storage stores one AAS per legacy asset. The AID/AIMC Submodel concept separates vendor-provided information (AID - Asset Interfaces Description with Available Endpoints based on W3C WoT TD) from user configuration (AIMC - Asset Interfaces Mapping Configuration with bidirectional mapping between asset and AAS SubmodelElements).

The Sync/Async Translation enables two modes: Either the latest status is buffered, or the request blocks until a response is available. AAS Interaction Types are classified into three levels: Type 1 (Passive: XML/JSON/RDF file exchange), Type 2 (Reactive: HTTP API for request-response), Type 3 (Proactive: autonomous inter-AAS communication, currently in standardization). The MMB forms a gateway between real-time (hard/soft real-time fieldbus systems) and non-real-time (HTTP-based cloud connection). The protocol translation bridges different communication patterns: Controller/Peripheral, Client/Server, and Pub/Sub.

The limitations of the MMB lie in the fact that AIMC does not allow data transformations (only 1:1 mapping), Type 3 Interaction is not yet standardized, and no fully automatic deployment is provided.

### 3.4 CMFM & Management Paradigms

The Comprehensive Management Function Model (CMFM, Soler Perez Olaya & Wollschlaeger, 2022; Soler Perez Olaya, 2019) offers a theoretical framework for human-centered management in heterogeneous industrial networks ("Network of Networks", cf. Soler Perez Olaya et al., 2019). Unlike system-centric approaches (SNMP value-based, SDN requirements-based), CMFM focuses on intent-based management: Users describe goals and desired outputs, and the system automatically derives necessary configurations. VIA adapts the CMFM philosophy for process communication: The M3 metamodel defines a VIA vocabulary (Elements: Process, Service, Registry; Verbs: register, discover, route; IPC Types: Pipe, Socket, TCP, FileQueue, Thread) from which the M2 compiler automatically generates orchestration logic.

**VIA Project Integration**: The VIA vocabulary is **yet to be defined** and will be documented in `playbooks/VIA-M3-Compiler/via_vocabulary.md` once it has been extracted from the AAS context. The CMFM structure (Goal, Output, Input, Constraints, Representation) is implemented at M3 level as AAS-lang constructs: Customer projects (`.via` files) describe their goals intent-based (e.g., "Connect Sensor A to Process B, maximize throughput, minimize latency"), and the VIA-M2 compiler automatically derives IPC mechanism (Pipe/Socket/TCP/FileQueue/Thread) and service positioning (same container/host/remote). The three management levels (Data/Control/Management) are cleanly separated in VIA: IPC (Data Plane), Process-Group-Protocol (Control Plane), Deploy-Protocol (Management Plane). This separation is to be specified as M3 models in `playbooks/VIA-M3-Compiler/via_protocols/`.

The CMFM (Comprehensive Management Function Model) contrasts human-centered management with system-centric management and enables various management paradigms: Value-based (SNMP with polling of values), Policy-based (intent-based goal specifications), Requirements-based (SDN/TSN with QoS requirements), and Ontology-based (semantic-based reasoning systems).

The strengths of CMFM lie in heterogeneity management for "Network of Networks", intent-based abstraction instead of low-level configuration, and knowledge transfer through standardized CMF definitions. The CMFM meta-model defines five components: Goal (mandatory, describes the objective), Output (mandatory, describes the expected output), Input (optional, describes necessary inputs), Constraints (optional, defines restrictions), and Representation (optional, various representation forms).

Constraints are classified into five types: Time (temporal restrictions), Order (sequence dependencies), Existence (existence conditions), Mutual Exclusiveness (mutual exclusion), and Execution Success (success criteria). The taxonomy enables hierarchical composition, where multiple super-CMFMs are possible.

The VIA vocabulary defines Elements (Process, Service, Registry, Scheduler, Router), Verbs (register, discover, route, schedule), and IPC Types (Pipe, Socket, TCP, FileQueue, Thread) as domain-specific vocabulary. The separation of Data/Control/Management Plane occurs through IPC (Data Plane), Orchestration (Control Plane), and CMFM (Management Plane), representing an improvement over legacy industrial systems.

VIA functions as a "Network of Networks" with holistic management for heterogeneous IPC mechanisms (Pipe, Socket, TCP, FileQueue, Thread) and enables seamless integration with access to different management systems and orchestration throughout. The legacy problem of industrial systems lies in missing separation of Data/Control/Management Planes, proprietary interfaces, and static configuration.

The limitations of CMFM lie in the fact that no compiler chain is provided, CMFM creation occurs manually, and vocabulary management is yet-to-standardize.

### 3.5 SOA & Microservice Architecture (Santiago Soler Perez Olaya et al., IECON 2024)

Service-oriented architectures (SOA, cf. Dragoni et al., 2017 for Microservices Survey) and microservices form the structural foundation for VIA processes. The research work by Santiago Soler Perez Olaya et al. (2024, IECON) demonstrates how AAS submodels can be implemented as standalone microservices that communicate via gRPC+Protobuf (cf. Google, 2020 for gRPC Performance Best Practices). Particularly relevant is the described code generation pipeline: OpenAPI specifications (AAS Spec) are transformed into Protobuf definitions (Google, 2023 for Protocol Buffers Language Guide), from which the protoc compiler generates language-specific code. VIA extends this approach with an additional abstraction layer (M3 metamodel) and automatic IPC optimization.

**VIA Project Integration**: VIA uses **Protobuf at M3 level** as an interpreter for metamodel definitions and customer project data (`playbooks/VIA-M3-Compiler/` uses Protobuf from `third_party/`). The VIA-M3 compiler generates `.proto` files for microservice communication, which are stored in `playbooks/VIA-M2-SDK/proto/`. Unlike Santiago Soler Perez Olaya's approach (OpenAPI → Protobuf → protoc), VIA follows the path: **M3 metamodel (in AAS-lang) → VIA-M3 compiler → Protobuf definitions + C++ SDK**. The "One microservice per Submodel" idea is implemented in VIA: Each AAS submodel is deployed as an independent VIA process (C++23 Module), where the M2 compiler automatically generates gRPC service stubs. The IPC optimization then selects at compile time: gRPC (remote), UNIX Socket (local, high-performance), or Thread-Messaging (same process).

Service-oriented architectures (SOA) are based on fundamental principles: Modularity for independent services, Abstraction for encapsulation of implementation details, Loose Coupling for minimal dependencies, Service Composition for flexible combination, and Reusability for reuse across system boundaries.

Automotive SOA uses SOME/IP (Autosar) for vehicle-internal communication, DDS (Publish/Subscribe) for real-time data distribution, and OPC UA for interoperability with backend systems. The Microservice Network for AAS implements "One microservice per Submodel", where Northbound HTTP API for clients, Internal gRPC for service-to-service communication, and Southbound Asset Protocol for hardware integration are used.

The combination of gRPC and Protobuf offers numerous advantages: High-performance with low-latency through HTTP/2 multiplexing, language interoperability for C++, C#, Python, Java, and Go, binary serialization for compact and efficient data transmission, backward/forward compatibility for version-safe evolution, and contract-first paradigm for clear API definition.

The code generation pipeline transforms OpenAPI (AAS Spec) into Protobuf (.proto files), which are translated by the protoc compiler into language-specific code (messages, service stubs). The AAS SDK integration uses aas-core-csharp for (de-)serialization and metamodel types. Container deployment occurs via Docker and Kubernetes with transparent relocation, where services are positioned near workload or gateway.

The limitations of this approach lie in the fact that Protobuf does not support inheritance (resort to composition), a duality exists between Protobuf-generated and AAS Core SDK classes, heterogeneous protocols are not unified, and manual orchestration is required.

### 3.6 IPC, Monitoring & Service Mesh (Related Work)

The choice of IPC mechanism has a fundamental influence on latency and scalability of distributed systems. Existing solutions such as gRPC (~0.5ms latency, but no service discovery), UNIX Domain Sockets (~20μs, local only, Stevens & Rago, 2013), DDS (Real-Time QoS, ~2ms overhead, Pardo-Castellote, 2003), and Service Mesh solutions like Istio/Linkerd (runtime routing, 5-10ms sidecar overhead, Li et al., 2019) require manual configuration and offer no compile-time optimization. For monitoring, established standards exist (SNMP for infrastructure, OPC UA for process data, MQTT for cloud connection according to OASIS, 2019), but an integrated view is missing. VIA addresses this fragmentation through compiler-supported unification: The M2 compiler automatically selects the optimal IPC mechanism based on process localization (same host → Pipe/Socket, remote → TCP/gRPC) and latency requirements.

**VIA Project Integration**: The **IPC Optimizer** in `playbooks/VIA-M2-SDK/ipc_optimizer.md` implements a graph-based algorithm for compile-time selection of the optimal IPC mechanism (**core of this research work**). The decision logic is defined in the M3 metamodel as template rules (`playbooks/VIA-M3-Compiler/templates/ipc_decision_logic.aas`), which the customer instantiates in their M2 project (`.via` files) with concrete constraints (e.g., "max_latency: 5ms", "same_host: true").

**Multi-Objective Optimization (Pareto Optimization)**: The M2 compiler executes a constraint solver (Z3, De Moura & Bjørner, 2008) at compile time that finds **Pareto-optimal solutions** (Deb et al., 2002 for NSGA-II; Marler & Arora, 2004 for MOO Survey) for conflicting goals:
- **Minimize latency** (μs range for Unix Socket, ms range for TCP)
- **Maximize throughput** (Messages/s, MB/s)
- **Minimize resource consumption** (CPU%, RAM MB, network bandwidth)

A solution is **Pareto-optimal** when no objective can be improved without worsening another. The constraint solver calculates the **Pareto frontier** (set of all non-dominated solutions) and selects the best trade-off solution based on customer constraints. The 5 IPC mechanisms (Pipe, Unix Socket, TCP, File-Queue, Thread-Messaging) are defined as AAS-lang enumerations in M3.

**In-the-Loop Self-Optimization**: VIA implements **autonomous cluster optimization** (inspired by Google Borg, Verma et al., 2015; Burns & Oppenheimer, 2016 for Kubernetes) through continuous telemetry evaluation:
- **Telemetry Metrics**: CPU load (%), RAM utilization (MB), disk I/O (MB/s), network latency (ms), message throughput (Messages/s)
- **Evaluation Loop**: Deploy-Protocol collects telemetry from all services → M2 compiler analyzes bottlenecks (cf. Xie et al., 2023 for PBScaler Bottleneck Detection) → Kubernetes load distribution is dynamically adjusted
- **Scope**: Processing services for measurement data (Edge-Devices → Aggregation → Analytics) + OPC UA protocol level (sub-protocols are virtually remapped via MMB between processing groups)
- **Feedback Loop**: New service positioning is tested as canary deployment, permanently adopted upon improvement of Pareto metrics, rollback in fractions of seconds upon degradation

Monitoring integration occurs via the Deploy-Protocol (logging, telemetry) and OPC UA (process data exposition).

The overview of existing approaches shows various strengths and weaknesses: gRPC uses HTTP/2 and Protobuf with approximately 0.5ms latency in single-host operation but offers no integrated service discovery. ZeroMQ implements message queues with five patterns (REQ/REP, PUB/SUB) but has no compiler integration. DDS (OMG Data Distribution Service) is optimized for real-time with QoS policies but causes approximately 2ms overhead and offers no metamodel abstraction.

Service Mesh solutions like Istio and Linkerd enable runtime routing with dynamic discovery but cause 5-10ms sidecar overhead per request. UNIX Domain Sockets offer approximately 20μs latency for local processes but do not support distributed orchestration across host boundaries.

**Systematic Service Mesh Comparison (VIA vs. State-of-the-Art)**:

The following table systematically compares VIA with leading Service Mesh solutions and alternative communication approaches:

**Core Difference: Compile-Time vs. Runtime Optimization**

The fundamental distinction between VIA and all Service Mesh solutions lies in the **timing of IPC decisions**:

1. **Service Mesh (Istio/Linkerd/Consul)**: Runtime decision by sidecar proxies
   - ✅ **Advantages**: Dynamic topology, traffic shifting without recompilation, canary rollouts at runtime
   - ❌ **Disadvantages**: 2-10ms proxy overhead, 20-80 MB memory per service, CPU load for routing logic

2. **VIA (Compile-Time)**: Static decision during M2 compilation
   - ✅ **Advantages**: Zero proxy overhead (direct IPC), optimal latency, minimal resources
   - ❌ **Disadvantages**: Recompilation upon topology changes, less runtime flexibility

**Trade-off Analysis (Hypothesis H2)**:

The central research question of this work is: **Can static compile-time optimization approximate the runtime flexibility of Service Meshes under defined constraints?**

- **Static Factories**: VIA optimal (15-25 years production lifetime, rare topology changes)
- **Dynamic Environments**: Service Mesh optimal (robotics, cloud-native microservices, A/B testing)
- **Hybrid Approach**: VIA with hot-reload for rare reconfigurations (~1x/month vs. Service Mesh ~100x/day)

SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) implements a manager-agent model with polling (GET requests every 60 seconds) and traps (push on events), uses a hierarchical MIB-OID structure, and defines standard MIBs like IF-MIB, HOST-RESOURCES-MIB, and ENTITY-SENSOR-MIB. The limits of SNMP lie in the flat OID list without object hierarchies, the polling paradigm without pub/sub support, the primary focus on monitoring rather than control, and the scaling limit with thousands of devices.

MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is pub/sub-based and broker-centric, optimized for IoT sensors and cloud connectivity, and extremely lightweight for bandwidth-critical applications. A recommended hybrid approach combines SNMP for infrastructure monitoring, OPC UA for detailed process data, and MQTT for cloud analytics.

The fundamental limitation of all mentioned approaches lies in the fact that they require manual configuration, offer no compile-time optimization, and cannot manage heterogeneous protocols in a unified manner.

### 3.7 Research Gaps

The analysis of the state of research reveals several fundamental gaps that this work addresses. No multi-stage compiler chain M3→M2→M1 specifically for process communication exists that automatically translates metamodel definitions into optimized IPC implementations. Automatic IPC mechanism selection at compilation is not provided in previous frameworks; instead, the choice occurs at runtime or through manual configuration.

Under OPC UA, no standardized sub-protocols for process grouping, deployment management, and IPC optimization are defined, although this functionality is urgently needed in industrial systems. Compile-time optimization of microservice positioning based on process dependencies and latency requirements is an unexplored area.

The trade-off between Service Mesh overhead (5-10ms sidecar latency) and potential compiler optimization has not been systematically investigated scientifically. In-the-loop self-optimization with Pareto metrics (latency, throughput, resource consumption) as an autonomous feedback loop does not exist in any known industrial framework. Finally, the concept of M3 library composition for protocol extensibility is missing, where new protocols can build upon existing M3 libraries.

### 3.8 Scientific Added Value of this Work

This research work makes several fundamental contributions that go beyond incremental improvements of existing systems:

#### 3.8.1 Theoretical Foundation through M3 Library Architecture

**MMB as M3 Library**: The embedding of the Multi-Message Broker (MMB) as a reusable M3 library demonstrates how research results from brownfield integration (Santiago Soler Perez Olaya et al.) can be operationalized as formal metamodel components. The three VIA sub-protocols (Edge-Group, Deploy, Process-Group) are **themselves defined as M3 libraries in AAS-lang** – analogous to Protobuf as M3 interpreter – and load models from MMB. This model composition at M3 level creates a **scientific foundation for extensible protocol architectures** in industrial automation.

**Reusability and Extensibility**: Through the separation of base library (MMB) and specialized protocols (Edge-Group/Deploy/Process-Group), a modular architecture emerges that enables future extensions. Other research projects can import MMB models and define their own protocol semantics – a paradigm that is missing in previous OPC UA Companion Specifications.

#### 3.8.2 Mathematical Rigor through Pareto Optimization

**Multi-Objective Optimization**: The application of Pareto optimization to IPC mechanism selection transforms a previously heuristic decision into a **formally solvable optimization problem**. The conflicting goals (minimize latency, maximize throughput, minimize resource consumption) are not solved through ad-hoc weighting but through calculation of the **Pareto frontier** – the set of all non-dominated solutions. This enables a **scientifically traceable justification** for each IPC decision and creates comparability between systems.

**Z3 Constraint Solver**: The integration of a formal constraint solver at compile time elevates the work beyond empirical benchmarks. The solutions are not only "well measured" but **provably optimal** within the defined constraints.

#### 3.8.3 Autonomous Systems through In-the-Loop Self-Optimization

**Feedback-Loop Architecture**: The continuous telemetry evaluation (CPU%, RAM, Disk I/O, network latency, message throughput) with automatic Kubernetes load distribution realizes **autonomous cluster optimization** – a core vision of Industry 5.0. The evaluation loop (Deploy-Protocol collects → M2 compiler analyzes → adjust load distribution → canary test → adoption/rollback) demonstrates **self-adapting systems** without human intervention.

**Scientific Contribution**: This work shows for the first time how compile-time optimization (Pareto frontier) and runtime adaptation (telemetry feedback) can be **complementarily combined**. Existing approaches are either purely static (manual configuration) or purely dynamic (Service Mesh) – VIA unites both paradigms.

#### 3.8.4 Nested Security Architectures

**Recursive Security Levels**: The ability of each protocol layer to form hierarchical security rules **separately from each other** (e.g., Device-Groups → Edge-Groups → Cluster-Groups → Global) addresses enterprise requirements in heterogeneous networks. This architecture is scientifically relevant because it realizes **separation of concerns** at protocol level – a previously unsolved problem in OPC UA Companion Specifications.

**Dynamic MMB Mapping**: The ability to **virtually remap sub-protocols between processing groups** (e.g., at bottleneck: instantiate new services, redirect data streams) demonstrates **runtime adaptivity** despite compile-time optimization – a fundamental contradiction that VIA resolves through the separation of protocol definition (M3, static) and protocol instantiation (MMB, dynamic).

#### 3.8.5 Bridging Compiler Design and Industrial Automation

**Interdisciplinary Innovation**: The application of compiler optimization techniques (M3/M2/M1 metamodel chain, constraint solving, code generation) to industrial process communication (OPC UA, IPC, service orchestration) creates a **new research direction** at the interface of computer science and automation engineering. The work shows that Industry 4.0 problems are solvable from a compiler perspective – a perspective that is missing in previous AAS implementations (Python scripts, manual orchestration).

## 4. Objectives and Research Methodology

### 4.1 Main Objective

The overarching goal of this research work is the development and evaluation of a fully automatic compiler system for Industry 4.0 systems with focus on the **Process-Group-Protocol subsystem**. Unlike existing approaches that select IPC mechanisms manually or at runtime, VIA shall make this decision at compile time while optimizing latency, throughput, and resource consumption.

### 4.2 Sub-objectives

The research work is structured into five sub-objectives, where this work primarily focuses on T2 (IPC optimization) and T4 (Process-Group-Protocol):

- **T1 (Context)**: VIA-M3 Compiler – Transformation of AAS M3 metamodel → C++ SDK
- **T2 (Research Focus)**: VIA-M2-SDK Compiler – Automatic IPC mechanism selection based on process dependencies
- **T3 (Context)**: VIA-M1-System Deployer – Distributed compilation, Horse-Rider deployment, Kubernetes orchestration
- **T4 (Research Focus)**: Sub-protocol design – Specification and implementation of the Process-Group-Protocol under OPC UA
- **T5 (Outlook)**: AI integration Industry 5.0 – Natural language system description → Automatic compilation

### 4.3 Research Methodology

The research methodology follows an engineering science approach with four main phases: Requirements Engineering, Design, prototypical implementation, and experimental evaluation.

#### 4.3.1 Methodological Approach

**Phase 1 – Requirements Engineering**: Definition of M3 model elements for describing process communication as an AAS extension. This includes the specification of dependency types (data-driven, control-driven, time-driven), latency requirements (soft real-time, best-effort), and resource constraints (memory, CPU, bandwidth).

**Phase 2 – Design**: Development of a compiler optimization algorithm for IPC mechanism selection. The algorithm models process dependencies as a directed graph on which a constraint solver (e.g., Z3) calculates a Pareto-optimal solution for latency, throughput, and resource consumption.

**Phase 3 – Prototypical Implementation**: Implementation of the M2-SDK compiler with IPC optimizer in C++20/23. The prototype generates complete system projects with optimized IPC setup (Pipe, Unix Socket, TCP, File-Queue, Thread-Messaging) from M2 project configurations.

**Phase 4 – Evaluation**: Experimental validation using benchmark suite and real-world use case. Comparative measurements against established baselines (gRPC, Istio Service Mesh, UNIX Sockets) for validation of hypotheses H1-H4.

**Tech-Tree Methodology (Benjamin-Elias Probst)**: The research employs an **iterative oscillation method** between Bottom-Up and Top-Down approaches for accelerated problem-solving:

1. **Bottom-Up Phase (Detail Exploration)**:
   - Starting point: A concrete technical insight (e.g., "Unix Sockets have 20μs latency")
   - Detailed analysis of this single insight across all aspects
   - Extraction of fundamental principles

2. **Top-Down Phase (Categorization)**:
   - Classification of the insight into **all relevant main categories**
   - Example: Unix Socket latency → Categories: IPC Mechanisms, Kernel Primitives, Network Stack, Operating System Abstraction, Performance Metrics
   - Systematic assignment to existing research fields

3. **Bottom-Up Phase (Analogy Search)**:
   - Searching identified categories for **similar implementations/information**
   - Example: In category "IPC Mechanisms" → Find: Pipes (5μs), Shared Memory (1μs), TCP (100μs)
   - Comparative analysis of all found alternatives

4. **Solution-First Thinking (Retroperspective)**:
   - **"As-If" Method**: Acting as if the problem is **already solved**
   - Deriving the consequences of the invention (e.g., "If VIA optimally chooses IPC → 100x lower latency")
   - **Reverse Engineering**: From consequences backwards to source documents
   - Identification: Which papers/standards must exist for the solution to work?

5. **Iterative Refinement**:
   - Cycle Bottom-Up → Top-Down → Bottom-Up is repeated
   - Each iteration refines understanding and expands the solution space
   - Convergence to optimal solution through systematic exploration

**Scientific Justification**: This methodology addresses the **Exploration-Exploitation Dilemma** of research:
- **Bottom-Up** = Exploitation (depth in known areas)
- **Top-Down** = Exploration (breadth across new categories)
- **Solution-First** = Constraint Propagation (narrowing search space through target criteria)

The approach resembles **Beam Search** in AI systems: Instead of exhaustive search (too slow) or greedy search (locally optimal), the **k most promising paths** are pursued in parallel. Categorization (Top-Down) identifies these k paths, Bottom-Up phases evaluate them.

**Application to VIA**: The development of the IPC-Optimizer followed this pattern:
1. **Initial**: Unix Socket latency 20μs (Bottom-Up detail)
2. **Categories**: IPC, Kernel, Service Mesh, Compiler Optimization (Top-Down)
3. **Analogies**: Z3 Constraint Solver found in Compiler Optimization (Bottom-Up)
4. **Solution-First**: "If compiler chooses IPC → Pareto-optimal → Z3 needed"

## 5. Theoretical Background

The research combines concepts from compiler theory (Section 5.1), metamodel architectures (Section 5.2), AAS standards (Section 5.3), OPC UA and ISA-95 integration (Section 5.4, cf. Wollschlaeger et al., 2025 for bidirectional AAS ↔ OPC UA mapping), process communication (Section 5.5), and management frameworks (Section 5.6). This interdisciplinary foundation is necessary to address the challenges of metamodel-based IPC optimization.

### 5.1 Compiler Theory

Compiler theory forms the technical foundation for VIA with multi-stage compilation across three levels (M3 → M2 → M1, cf. Aho et al., 2006; Lattner & Adve, 2004 for LLVM architecture), where each stage performs specific transformations. Code generation is template-based and type-safe to guarantee type safety at compile time. Metaprogramming uses C++20 Concepts (ISO/IEC 14882:2020) for constraint-based template specialization and constexpr for compile-time evaluation of complex expressions.

### 5.2 Metamodel Architectures (M3/M2/M1)

The metamodel architecture consists of three abstraction levels (IEC 63278-1:2024; Hofer, 2009 for OPC UA Information Model): M3 defines the metamodel where Objects, Variables, and Methods exist as abstract concepts; M2 represents the model with VIA-specific types like VIAProcessType and VIARouterType; M1 forms the instance level with running systems and concrete process instances.

### 5.3 Asset Administration Shell

The Asset Administration Shell according to IEC 63278 defines a standardized metamodel for digital twins in Industry 4.0. Submodels enable modular data description through independent, reusable components. The AID/AIMC concept separates Asset Interface Description (vendor-provided interface definition) from Asset Interfaces Mapping Configuration (user-configured mapping between asset and AAS).

### 5.4 OPC UA Information Model & ISA-95 Integration

The OPC UA Information Model is based on M3-based type definitions that provide a metamodel for objects, variables, and methods. Companion Specifications extend OPC UA with domain-specific functionality, including DI (Device Integration), I4AAS (Industry 4.0 AAS), and PLCopen. The Address Space organizes nodes hierarchically and object-oriented.

The ISA-95 Levels (ISA-95, 2010) define functional layers that are extended in the Reference Architecture Model Industry 4.0 (RAMI 4.0, Adolphs et al., 2015): Level 2 (SCADA: process level with real-time requirements), Level 3 (MES: manufacturing execution level), and Level 4 (ERP: enterprise level). SCADA systems capture process data, send control commands, manage alarming and historization, and provide visualization via HMI. MES systems manage production orders, perform detailed scheduling, implement quality assurance, calculate OEE and KPIs, enable traceability, and communicate bidirectionally with SCADA. OPC UA (IEC 62541-1:2020) acts as mediator and provides standardized access for SCADA, MES, ERP, and cloud systems (cf. Grüner et al., 2019 for OPC UA I4.0 Communication Architectures).

### 5.5 Process Communication

Process communication uses various IPC mechanisms: Pipe for sequential process chains, Socket for local bidirectional communication, TCP for remote communication, File-Queue for asynchronous persistent messages, and Thread-Messaging for intra-process communication. The architecture separates Data Plane (actual data transfer), Control Plane (routing and orchestration), and Management Plane (configuration and monitoring). gRPC and Protobuf implement contract-first development with binary serialization for compact and efficient data transfer.

### 5.6 CMFM (Comprehensive Management Function Model)

CMFM implements a manager-centric paradigm focusing on goals rather than system details, in contrast to system-centric approaches. CMF components include Goal (mandatory, describes management objective), Output (mandatory, expected output), Input (optional, required inputs), Constraints (optional, restrictions), and Representations (optional, various representation forms).

The Generality Hierarchy defines abstraction levels: Implementation (concrete implementation), User (user-specific), Domain (domain-specific), Parent Domain (superior domain). VIA as Domain represents the entire process communication domain as a unified concept. Catalog vs. Core distinguishes between the list of all CMFs and generally applicable CMFs after promotion.

Promotion occurs tacitly (automatically through frequent use) or explicitly (through Standardization Bodies). CMF Interrelations include Equivalence (merging goals with identical meaning into one CMF) and Composition (Upwards: aggregation of multiple CMFs, Downwards: decomposition into Sub-CMFs). AAS Integration maps CMFs as Operations in the AAS Meta-Model, where Input and Output are represented as Attributes.

VIA CMFs define process-register (process registration), process-discover (service discovery), route-message (message routing), and schedule-task (task scheduling). Vocabulary Management occurs through a public repository linked to e-Class, CDD (Common Data Dictionary), and I4.0 SemanticID.

## 6. Conceptual Approach: VIA Architecture

### 6.0 VIA Main Program (Orchestration M3→M2→M1)

**Project Location**: `src/main.cpp` (versioned)

The conceptual classification of the main program within the overall system was covered in Section 2.3.0. This section specifies the detailed input/output architecture.

#### Input
- User description of desired system (code comments in `.via` files or natural language text file for future AI integration)
- Configuration: Target architectures (MIPS, RISC-V, x86, ARM, etc.), deployment targets (Kubernetes Cluster, Edge Devices), network topology (optional via Network Discovery)

#### Processing
- **Phase Coordination**: Sequential invocation of 8-stage bootstrap cycle (see Section 2.3.0): M3-Compiler-Build → M3-Test → M2-SDK-Generation → M2-SDK-Build → Customer-Project-Compilation → M1-System-Build → Deployment → Server Mode
- **Pipeline Management**: Output of each phase becomes input of the next, stored in versioned (`build/via-m3-compiler`, `src/main.cpp`) or gitignored folders (`playbooks/VIA-M2-SDK/`, `playbooks/VIA-M1-System/`, `build/binaries/`)
- **State Management**: Persistence of intermediate results as CMake build artifacts and generated project folders
- **Error Handling**: Rollback on error through version control (git) for versioned parts, transactional re-execution for gitignored parts
- **User Interaction**: CLI with structured output (progress bars, test results), OPC UA Server for remote monitoring

#### Output
- **End-to-End**: From `.via` customer project files to deployed system on >50,000 edge devices
- **Traceability**: Complete audit trail (comments propagate through M3→M2→M1→M0, end up in binary headers)
- **Logs**: Each phase documented in `build/logs/` (for debugging, reproducibility), Deploy-Protocol for remote logs
- **Deployed Binaries**: `build/binaries/{arch}/{device_id}/` with header documentation

#### Special Features
- **Self-Reference**: Main program can recompile itself (M3→M2→M1→M0), starts new instance via process communication and terminates after successful handover
- **Transactionality**: Atomic phases with rollback mechanism (old binaries retained for rollback within seconds)
- **Parallelization**: Orchestrate multiple customer projects simultaneously (GitHub Runners for Distributed Compilation, see Section 2.3.3)

### 6.1 VIA-M3-Compiler (Metamodel → SDK)

**Project Location**: `playbooks/VIA-M3-Compiler/` (versioned)

The VIA-M3-Compiler receives as input the AAS IEC 63278 text specification (IEC 63278-1:2024), which is automatically transformed into M3 code via SITL (Software-in-the-Loop), OPC UA IEC 62541 (IEC 62541-1:2020) as M3 library (also loaded via SITL if not present), and VIA-Extensions for process communication as custom M3 definitions in AAS-lang (cf. Völter et al., 2019 for mbeddr as blueprint for extensible DSL-based compiler).

Processing is performed through C++20/23 metaprogramming with a custom template engine defined in AAS-lang itself (not in Python as in aas-core-works). Constraint validation is executed via the M3 test framework, where Protobuf serves as M3 interpreter from `third_party/protobuf` for reading model and customer data.

As output, the compiler generates the directory `playbooks/VIA-M2-SDK/` with gitignored, generated C++ code, OPC UA NodeSet XML in `output/via_companion_spec.xml`, Protobuf `.proto` files for microservice communication in `proto/`, and comprehensive documentation with propagated M3 comments that reach binary headers.

The special feature is that the compiler is maintainable and versioned in contrast to aas-core-works Python scripts, designed as production-ready compiler with complete test framework, and avoids spaghetti code through a multi-layered constraint system.

### 6.2 VIA-M2-SDK-Compiler (SDK → Customer System)

**Project Location**: `playbooks/VIA-M2-SDK/` (generated, gitignored)

The VIA-M2-SDK-Compiler receives as input customer project files (`customer_project/*.via` written in AAS-lang), optionally a network topology via Network Discovery (`network_discovery.md`), and deployment targets with target architectures and operating systems.

Processing encompasses multiple phases: First, syntax validation of `.via` files occurs, followed by Network Discovery Scanner for SNMP, OPC UA, and Modbus. Auto-suggestions for system configuration are generated via `auto_suggestions.md`. IPC optimization in `ipc_optimizer.md` forms the research focus and implements a graph-based algorithm with constraint solver for compile-time decisions. The test generator in `test_generator.md` automatically creates deterministic tests from M3 constraints.

As output, the compiler generates the directory `playbooks/VIA-M1-System/` (gitignored, complete C++ overall project), Kubernetes Manifests as `deployment.yaml`, Edge Modules as C++23 Modules for Horse-Rider deployment, and generated tests with propagated customer comments for complete traceability.

The special feature lies in Release Mode, where the C++ output stream is piped directly into g++ via memory filesystem/RAM for maximum performance, and Debug Mode, which provides project files with comprehensive documentation for developer inspection.

### 6.3 VIA-M1-System-Deployer (System → Production)

**Project Location**: `playbooks/VIA-M1-System-Deploy/` (Playbooks for deployment logic)

The VIA-M1-System-Deployer receives as input the M1 system project from `playbooks/VIA-M1-System/`, deployment targets as architecture map for MIPS, RISC-V, ARM, x86 and other architectures, and customer-defined system tests as rough predefinition.

Processing occurs in several specialized phases: Distributed Compilation via GitHub Runners enables parallel builds of all modules (see `distributed_build.md`). Cross-Compilation with multi-architecture toolchain management is performed in `cross_compilation.md`. Horse-Rider-Deployment with C++23 Modules, stable ABIs, hot-reload and canary deployment follows `horse_rider_deployment.md`. Master Active Management orchestrates the entire deployment according to `master_active_management.md`.

As output, a deployed system for more than 50,000 edge devices emerges with binaries in `build/binaries/{arch}/{device_id}/`, deployment manifests for Kubernetes and edge devices, versioned binaries with header documentation for external edge programming, and a digital twin with monitoring and logging.

The special feature lies in the hot-reload mechanism, where the Horse service loads a new Rider service parallel to the old one, performs a canary test, and switches traffic on success. Rollback occurs within fractions of seconds on errors by retaining the old version. Redundancy is ensured through at least two parallel Horses per edge device as digital twin.

### 6.4 Sub-Protocols under OPC UA

**Project Location**: `playbooks/VIA-M3-Compiler/via_protocols/` (future, **specification in planning**)

**M3 Library Architecture**: The three VIA sub-protocols are **themselves defined as M3 libraries in AAS-lang** (analogous to Protobuf as M3 interpreter). They are implemented as models in `playbooks/VIA-M3-Compiler/via_protocols/` and **load models from the MMB library** (`playbooks/VIA-M3-Compiler/third_party/mmb/`) as foundation.

The MMB architecture (Consistency Layer, Mapping Layer, Many-to-Many Broadcast) is implemented at M3 level as reusable library. The three sub-protocols import MMB models and extend them with VIA-specific semantics:
- **Edge-Group-Protocol**: Imports MMB broadcast models → extends with hierarchical grouping
- **Deploy-Protocol**: Imports MMB mapping models → extends with versioning/telemetry
- **Process-Group-Protocol**: Imports MMB consistency models → extends with IPC optimization

This model composition at M3 level enables **reusability** and **extensibility** – analogous to Protobuf, which also loads and transforms models.

#### 6.4.1 Edge-Group-Protocol (External World Layer)

The Edge-Group-Protocol implements virtual network groups for hierarchical edge device grouping and avoids individual coordination through intelligent grouping of targets.

The architecture is based on hardcoded messages, where group properties are compiled into binaries at compile time to prevent runtime code changes for security reasons. Binary ABI stability is ensured through C++23 Modules with stable interfaces, so each edge device knows itself where it belongs. Nested security levels enable hierarchical grouping (Device-Groups → Edge-Groups → Cluster-Groups → Global) with recursive security rules per level. Virtual network streams divide the external world into separate processing groups with different QoS guarantees for latency, throughput, and packet arrival reliability.

Performance benefits from no virtual router being necessary, maintaining time criticality since routing decisions are already made at compile time. Dynamic MMB mapping enables Edge-Groups to be virtually remapped via MMB between processing groups at runtime, for example during network reconfiguration, failure, or load shifting.

#### 6.4.2 Deploy-Protocol (Management Layer)

The Deploy-Protocol manages versioning, system updates, and rejuvenation for the Horse-Rider system, forming the management layer of the VIA architecture.

The architecture implements strict separation, where metadata and measurement data of computers are managed separately from facility data to encapsulate different responsibilities. Logging encompasses network logs for error analysis and telemetry collection of CPU load in percent, RAM utilization in megabytes, and disk I/O. Horse-Rider integration enables protocol management through the deployment service with canary deployment, hot-reload, and rollback mechanisms. Nested security levels define versioning policies per cluster or group, for example "Production: stable only" or "Staging: canary allowed".

In-the-loop self-optimization is realized through a continuous feedback loop: The Deploy-Protocol collects telemetry from all services, the M2 compiler analyzes bottlenecks, Kubernetes load distribution is dynamically adjusted, new positioning is tested as canary, and upon improvement of Pareto metrics (latency, throughput, resource consumption), the new configuration is permanently adopted.

Dynamic MMB mapping enables deployment groups to be reorganized at runtime, for example by moving all Analytics services to dedicated high-RAM nodes.

#### 6.4.3 Process-Group-Protocol (Data Layer) → **Core of this Research**

The Process-Group-Protocol forms the core of this research and implements transparent IPC optimization between services, separating program control from data.

The architecture defines five IPC mechanisms (Pipe, Unix Socket, TCP, File-Queue, Thread-Messaging) as AAS-lang Enumerations in the M3 metamodel. Automation is performed by the M2-SDK compiler, which automatically creates process chains of microservices based on process dependencies. Compile-time optimization uses a constraint solver (Z3) that calculates the Pareto frontier for conflicting goals (minimize latency, maximize throughput, minimize resource consumption). Cluster distribution enables virtual further processing or subdivision into subtasks on other containers or machines. Nested security levels allow IPC communication per process group to have different encryption and authentication levels.

Dynamic MMB mapping enables the process communication topology to be remapped at runtime via MMB. A typical pipeline runs from edge devices via aggregation services to analytics services. At bottlenecks, new aggregation services can be instantiated and data streams redirected via virtual mapping. The sub-protocol organizes itself separately from Edge-Group-Protocol and Deploy-Protocol in the overall network, enabling independent optimization of each layer.

A Windows limitation exists in that IPC capabilities are more limited on Windows systems, particularly Unix Sockets are missing as high-performance local communication option.

---

**Protocol Interaction**: The three sub-protocols can organize and group themselves **separately from each other** in the overall network, each with its own **nested and recursive security levels**. Dynamic orchestration via MMB enables virtual network streams with different characteristics (latency-critical, throughput-optimized, security-hardened).

**Status**: Specification of the 3 protocols will be defined during the project course as M3 models, based on MMB-M3 library

## 7. Expected Results

The research aims for both scientific contributions (Section 7.1) and practical results (Section 7.2). Evaluation is performed using a concrete use-case scenario from automotive production (Section 7.3) that demonstrates industrial relevance. The expected results directly address the formulated hypotheses H1-H4 and contribute to closing the identified research gaps.

### 7.1 Scientific Contributions (Focus on Process Communication)

The scientific contributions of this work comprise five core elements. Contribution B1 delivers a metamodel extension for process communication in AAS M3, implemented as VIA-Extensions in `playbooks/VIA-M3-Compiler/`, defining IPC types (Pipe, Socket, TCP, FileQueue, Thread) as AAS-lang Enumerations and providing a constraint system for latency requirements and resource constraints.

Contribution B2 develops a compiler optimization algorithm for IPC mechanism selection, implemented in `playbooks/VIA-M2-SDK/ipc_optimizer.md`, using a graph-based approach with constraint solver (Z3), performing Pareto optimization for latency, throughput, and resource consumption, and enabling compile-time decisions with optional runtime adaptation.

Contribution B3 specifies the Process-Group-Protocol as OPC UA sub-protocol in `playbooks/VIA-M3-Compiler/via_protocols/process_group_protocol.md` with integration of the open62541 Dynamic Address Space API and a hybrid model of static types and dynamic instances.

Contribution B4 performs a benchmark comparison between compiler optimization, service mesh, and manual configuration, where the evaluation environment comprises a 3-node Kubernetes cluster (64 core, 256 GB RAM) and Mininet for scaling tests up to 1,000 nodes, with four scenarios S1-S4 according to Section 4.3.2.

Contribution B5 provides a scalability proof for more than 100,000 services with hierarchical grouping, where the Edge-Group-Protocol enables hierarchical grouping (Edge-Groups → Cluster-Groups → Global) with the goal of linear scaling behavior (Hypothesis H3).

### 7.2 Practical Results

The practical results are structured into four deliverables. Result E1 comprises an M2-SDK compiler prototype with IPC-Optimizer as open-source implementation, realized in C++20/23 under `playbooks/VIA-M2-SDK/` with complete test framework, generating executable M1 system projects in `playbooks/VIA-M1-System/`.

Result E2 delivers a benchmark suite for IPC performance with metrics for latency (P50/P95/P99 percentiles), throughput (messages/s), CPU load (%), and memory footprint (MB), where automatic test execution occurs via the generated Deploy-Protocol.

Result E3 implements a use case for SCADA, MES, and PLC edge integration as exemplary scenario with 100 PLC edge devices (MIPS/ARM), 10 MES servers (x86), 3 SCADA servers (x86), and 5 analytics services (Kubernetes Pods), where the process chain transforms 1Hz production data via 0.1Hz aggregation to event-based alarms.

Result E4 creates a standardization proposal for the VIA Process-Group-Protocol for submission to the OPC Foundation, encompassing the VIA Custom Companion Specification (VIAProcessType, VIARouterType, VIASchedulerType, VIARegistryType), documented as OPC UA NodeSet XML for review as official Companion Spec.

### 7.3 Concrete Evaluation Criteria

#### 7.3.1 Use-Case Scenario: Automotive Production (Exemplary)

The exemplary use-case scenario from automotive production serves to validate the VIA architecture in a realistic industrial context. The system architecture comprises 100 PLC edge devices for robotic arms, conveyor belts, and test stations on MIPS or ARM with Linux, 10 MES servers as Manufacturing Execution System on x86 with Windows Server, 3 SCADA servers for Supervisory Control and visualization on x86 with Linux, and 5 analytics services for Predictive Maintenance and Quality Control as Kubernetes Pods.

The exemplary process chain proceeds as follows: PLC edge sends production data to MES with 1 Hz frequency and 1 KB message size, MES aggregates and sends data to Analytics with 0.1 Hz and 10 KB, Analytics generates alarms and forecasts for SCADA event-based with 100 bytes, and SCADA sends control commands back to PLC edge with 0.5 Hz and 50 bytes.

The quantitative success metrics define measurable target values: Latency P95 under 5ms for the end-to-end process chain, throughput over 10,000 messages per second for the overall system, CPU load under 20% per service, memory footprint under 50 MB per service, and development time reduction from 8 hours manual to 2 hours metamodel-generated, representing a 75% reduction.

#### 7.3.2 Comparison with Baselines

**Note**: The following values are **project goals and literature estimates**, not measured results. VIA values will be empirically determined in Phase 5 (Evaluation).

| Metric | gRPC (Literature)[^1] | Istio Service Mesh (Literature)[^2] | UNIX Sockets (Literature)[^3] | ROS2 DDS (Literature)[^4] | VIA (Project Goal) |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|--------------|------------------|------------|
| Latency P95 | ~0.5-2ms (local) | +3-7ms Overhead | ~20-50μs (local) | ~2ms (local FastRTPS) | To measure |
| Throughput | Architecture-dependent | -20-40% vs. native | Very high (local) | Architecture-dependent | To measure |
| CPU Load | Baseline | +0.20 vCPU/Sidecar | Minimal (local) | DDS overhead | To measure |
| Config Time | 8h (manual) | 4h (runtime setup) | N/A (local only) | 4-6h (roslaunch) | Goal: <3h (compile-auto) |

[^4]: Maruyama et al. (2016), Exploring the performance of ROS2. Latency ~2ms (local) with FastRTPS DDS implementation. ROS2 offers better QoS guarantees than ROS1, but higher latency due to DDS middleware overhead.

#### 7.3.3 Multi-Level Debugging & Revision Management

A central advantage of the VIA architecture lies in **bidirectional metamodel traceability** across all abstraction levels (M3 ↔ M2 ↔ M1 ↔ M0). This capability addresses a fundamental weakness of ROS, where modules in arbitrary languages can be inserted at any level, quickly leading to confusion, especially when models are not defined in common modeling languages at M3, but directly implemented at M2 or hard-coded at M1.

**Reverse-Engineering Capability**: VIA enables reverse translation of software architecture from M2 (customer-specific model language concepts) and from M1 (implemented code) back to M3. Through recompilation, it is tested whether the M3-reconstructed models can be compiled again to M2 and M1 and deliver the same semantic level for M0 modules. This ensures **Semantic Consistency** across the entire metamodel stack.

**Revision Management across all Meta Layers**: Revision management (part of Section 2.3 Main Program) forms a sub-framework of the main program and manages:

- **All Code Sections & Components**: Complete overview of all existing modules, services, and external frameworks
- **Meta Location**: Assignment of each element to its position in the metamodel (M3/M2/M1/M0)
- **Implementation & Compilation Dependencies**: Dependency graph across all levels with bidirectional traceability
- **Semantic Meaning**: Formal semantic annotations enabling reverse engineering

**Debugging Architecture**: Revision management is tightly coupled with the multi-level debugging system:

1. **M0 → M1 Tracing**: Runtime errors are localized at code level
2. **M1 → M2 Tracing**: Code errors are traced back to model level
3. **M2 → M3 Tracing**: Model errors are mapped to metamodel concepts
4. **M3 → M2 → M1 Recompilation**: Corrected metamodels are consistently recompiled

**Comment Function & Documentation**: Revision management organizes the propagation of comments across all levels:
- **M3 Comments**: Semantic description of metamodel concepts
- **M2 Comments**: Architecture documentation for models
- **M1 Comments**: Inline code documentation
- **Bidirectional Propagation**: Changes in M1 comments can be propagated to M2/M3

**Distinction from ROS**: While ROS offers no formal metamodel hierarchy and no reverse-engineering capability, VIA guarantees end-to-end traceability through revision management and enables model-driven round-trip engineering.

**Project Location**: `playbooks/VIA-M2-SDK/revision_management.md` (future, **specification in planning**)

### 7.4 Limitations

The research is subject to five essential limitations. Limitation L1 consists in that compile-time optimization requires a static topology, where dynamic changes necessitate recompilation, limiting runtime flexibility.

Limitation L2 lies in that the developed M3 model elements are not yet standardized in the official AAS specification, whereby interoperability with other AAS implementations is initially limited.

Limitation L3 concerns cross-architecture performance, which varies between different platforms (MIPS vs. x86), resulting in different optimization results for heterogeneous systems.

Limitation L4 consists in that the laboratory environment with three nodes requires extrapolation to more than 50,000 devices, where scaling behavior in production environments may deviate from simulated results.

Limitation L5 concerns hypotheses H1-H4, which are formulated as assumptions to be tested. Their empirical validation depends on the quality of the IPC-Optimizer and the representativeness of the benchmark scenarios. A failure of individual hypotheses (e.g., H1 in certain latency scenarios) does not impair the core contributions of this work (metamodel extension, Process-Group-Protocol specification, Pareto optimization algorithm), as these have scientific value independent of empirical validation results.

### 8.6 Overall Duration and Resources

**Total Duration**: 6 years (Q4 2024 - Q3 2033)

**Development Effort** (estimated):
- **Year 1-2** (Phase 1): 1 FTE (fundamental research, doctoral candidate)
- **Year 2-3** (Phase 2): 2-3 FTE (M3-Compiler development, team expansion)
- **Year 3-4** (Phase 3): 3-4 FTE (M2-SDK + Process-Group-Protocol, full-time team)
- **Year 4-5** (Phase 4): 4-5 FTE (M1-Deployer + Edge-Group-Protocol, scale-up)

**Funding Sources**:
- Doctoral scholarship (TU Dresden)
- Industry partners (co-funding for pilot deployments)
- Research funding (e.g., BMWi ZIM, BMBF, EU Horizon)

**Risk Management**:
- **Technical Risk**: Pareto optimization does not scale → Fallback to heuristic algorithms
- **Standardization Risk**: OPC Foundation rejects sub-protocols → Publication as community standard
- **Market Risk**: Industry does not adopt VIA → Open-source community as carrier
